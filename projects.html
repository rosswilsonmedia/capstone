                <p>The Capstone course is all about students creating projects of their own, either in collaboration with one another or individually. These projects are the result of months of hard work, and we can't wait to share them with you. Below you can find out more about each of the projects created in Capstone this semester, their creators, and where you can find them.</p>

                    <p>As a Digital Media Studies student in the Music Industry capstone, it seemed only natural that my project be a music video. While searching for a (copyright-free) song to craft a music video around, I stumbled upon and was instantly drawn to "Coping". This instrumental song by Butler Alum John Verdico was included on the Butler Music Industry Association Sampler Vol. 3, which is a CD of student made songs, made in 2015.</p>
